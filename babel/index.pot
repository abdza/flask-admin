msgid "**Why Flask?** As a micro-framework, `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ lets you build web services with very little overhead. It offers freedom for you, the designer, to implement your project in a way that suits your particular application."

msgid "**Why Flask-Admin?** In a world of micro-services and APIs, Flask-Admin solves the boring problem of building an admin interface on top of an existing data model. With little effort, it lets you manage your web service's data through a user-friendly interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.rst:15
msgid "**How does it work?** The basic concept behind Flask-Admin, is that it lets you build complicated interfaces by grouping individual views together in classes: Each web page you see on the frontend, represents a method on a class that has explicitly been added to the interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.rst:20
msgid "These view classes are especially helpful when they are tied to particular database models, because they let you group together all of the usual *Create, Read, Update, Delete* (CRUD) view logic into a single, self-contained class for each of your models."
